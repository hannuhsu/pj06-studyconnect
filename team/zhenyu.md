Description:
My name is Zhenyu and I'm a 4th year CS student.

For this project, my main ideas are to implement an account system for users for UCSB (and possibly other schools) so that they can login with their school email and be authenticated. Every class offered during the quarter should be available. There should be a system for users to make posts or message each other to connect to study. Students should also be able to ask questions about the class in that class's board/space.
