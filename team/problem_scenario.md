Problem scenario: </br >
A student user starts their quarter off in a class where they don’t know anyone. They want to meet someone in this class to study with for the next test, but don’t feel comfortable just approaching someone in person. The goal of the user is to find a way to connect with someone from their class without randomly just talking to someone. 

The user can use our product to make a post or request for a study partner for the class, and anyone else using the product can see this and decide to connect. Our product will help connect anyone who wants to study together with their peers.
