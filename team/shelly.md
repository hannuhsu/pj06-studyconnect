My name is Shelly Zhu and I'm a fourth year CS major.

For this project, my ideas primarily focus on connecting students within the same college classes to make studying together more accessible and less intimidating. It will allow users to create profiles using their verified college email addresses. Once logged in, users can search for their classes from a dynamically updated list that reflects the current offerings. 

Then, users will be able to post notices for study partners, class, their availability, and any preferences for study sessions (e.g., online or in-person), etc. These posts will appear on a centralized board for each class where other students can browse and respond. I think we can also include a simple messaging system to enable easy communication between users once a connection is made, if possible.
