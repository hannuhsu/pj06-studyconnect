Name: Maria Saucedo-Flores

I am a fourth year CS-Major, my pronouns are she/they. 

For this project, some of my current ideas are to implement organized groupchats and forum posting
features to make it easy for students to form groups with each other without the usual privacy concerns 
that come from posting on public Reddit pages. I also want to implement a Google OAuth system that only 
lets in people with the @ucsb.edu domain make an account and view posts.
