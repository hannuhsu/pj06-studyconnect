## Description of Me:

I'm a 2nd year CS Major at UCSB.

For the project, it would be nice to consider accessibility features as we have students with disabilities (so having tools for people who may need support, e.g. access to study rooms that are easy to get to). Since our goal for this project is to help students study together with ease, considering these stuents may be crucial too. We should offer group chats or a place to talk for each individual class.
