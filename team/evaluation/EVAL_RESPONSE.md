### Decisions Made

Decisions your team is making regarding the feedback on your USER_FEEDBACK_NEEDS.md

### Future Plans

Additional decisions your team is making based on feedback you received. 
Please reference what reviewing form section (numbers 2-5 above) the feedback you are reacting to came from 
(this is important to the teaching team!) and state your plans regarding that feedback. 
(Not all plans need to be able to be implemented - it is ok to talk about stretch goals. 
The important part is the team discussion regarding the best possible end product.)
