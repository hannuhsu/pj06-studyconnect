### Decisions Made based on User Feedback
1. Bug fix issues found by testers (navigation issues for new users, inability to post to class forum) before continuing with new feature implementation
2. Keep UCSB color scheme, as users found it 'official' looking, but work on making webapp more intuitive to navigate through with clearer navigation
3. Begin implementing new features:

   i. Add ability to view other user profiles

   ii. Add feature to send friend requests to users

   iii. Implement private chatrooms for friended users

### Future Plans
Additional decisions your team is making based on feedback you received. 

#### Feedback based on Section 2
1. Fix bug where users could not post to the forum page
2. Fix bug where webapp did not take new users straight to profile creation page to make their profiles before adding courses

#### Feedback based on Section 3
1. Update UI to have less "white space," but keep the UCSB look

#### Feedback based on Section 5
1. Add feature for displaying others' profiles
2. Add implementation for a friend system
3. Add private chatrooms
