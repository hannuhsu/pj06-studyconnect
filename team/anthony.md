##Description of Me:##

I'm a 4th year CS Major at UCSB! I have some experience with React, Next, and AWS, and I'm looking forward to learning more about these technologies + more and coding something cool and useful!

#Ideas for project:#

1. Functional Features
   a. class groupchat
   b. study room booking API
   c. resource upload (notes, lecture slides, papers)
   d. integrate AI helper?
   e. friend system

2. Non-functional Features
   a. scalability (support lot of users)
   b. low latency (speedy access, low buffering times)
   c. intuitive design + ease of use (ui/ux design)
