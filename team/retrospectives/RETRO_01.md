* Led by: Maria Saucedo-Flores
* Present: Allen Hu, Anthony Jin, Maria Saucedo-Flores, Shelly Zhu, Wesley Chiba, Zhenyu Yu, Hannah Su
* Absent: None

## Action item

* Goal: The team would like to get better at communicating expectations on the project clearly with each other.  

* Change/Experiment: The team would like to create a visual representation of the page layouts for the website
  so that it is more clear to each other what everyone expects the functionality to look like. The team would also
  like to increase response rates on the Slack channel so that it is known that the team is actively listening. 

* Measurement: To measure if this goal works, we will look for more messages being sent on Slack over the next week, as
  well as documenting the results of Monday's meeting to create visuals of what the webpages, and will ask team at the end
  of the next sprint if having those visuals helped make deliverables more clear.


## Retro Assessment 

* Our team used the Start, Stop, Continue Retro format. We started by having teams individually come up with a list of any
mix of the three categories for things they observed in the team's first week working together. Then, we had people share
their points outloud and comment on similar ones to create the goals for the next sprint.
  
* I think the intial part of the retrospective went well, as everyone got their points ready within the first 10 minutes of the meeting.
After that however, it felt a bit more awkward to get people to speak outloud, and I believe I was a little too forward with my prompting
people to speak outloud, which may have made the group nervous. Despite that however, the group was able to come to a consensus on two 
main goals they'd like to work on in the next sprint: communication and clarity. So I believe the retro was a success. 

* Based on what I observed today, I suggest the next person practices getting people to participate ahead of time, or preparing some
prompts that will get the group to start thinking about solutions to fill in the silence when people were debating whether or not they
wanted to speak. 

## Experiment/Change

* Our experiment for communication is to make sure to reply or at least react to messages sent on slack to let people know it has been seen.
For the goal of clarity, together on Monday the group will create rough sketches and ideas of the format they'd like the webapp to be in, and 
notes on how each page should function. 

* The group used the following website to plan out the layout for the webapp: https://excalidraw.com/#room=72b092f5df5b7369bcf0,r9PKs_tsliApAquWMr08Lw

With this visualization, it feels more clear what format the pages are going to be in, and how the class selection is going to work. Since some 
aspects were labeled as "not needed for the MVP," it also feels like we aren't piling too much work on for the 1 week we have left to implement and
record it, and now there is a document to reference when confused, that can have specifics pointed to when asking for help from rest of team. 

* A decision going forward: We've noticed that communication was definitely more active this week, and people were usually replied to within 24 hours even if the day they sent a message wasn't a day we had class. So we will be continuing to communicate on slack with emoji reactions to let people know the messages have been seen if we don't have anything to say.
