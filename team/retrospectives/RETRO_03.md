# Date of Retrospective: 03/05/25

* Led by: [Shelly Zhu]
* Present: Allen Hu, Anthony Jin (Remote), Maria Saucedo-Flores, Shelly Zhu, Wesley Chiba, Zhenyu Yu, Hannah Su
* Absent: None

## Retro Outcomes 

* We used the Start, Stop, Continue retro format. The team typed up what they thought we should start, stop, continue in the team Slack and submit at the same time. Then we identified the common points and had people elaborate.
* I think this retro helped us identify key areas for improvement at this point. For the final product, we can still get better at communication, task management, and UI design for final product. We recognized that while progress is being made, there is still room to streamline our workflow and ensure everyone stays aligned.
* We also recognized what we've done well so far, which is good communication in slack and substantial progress towards the final product. Our core functionalities are working well and everyone was able to stay on track of their tasks. 
* This time, people were more comfortable with this retro format and were able to speak up and share their thoughts. As we approach the final line, we hope to maintain our good communication and work together to finish the project. 


## Report
* Success: 
1. Kanban board: We've been doing better at updating the Kanban board and assigning tasks to everyone.
2. PR communication: PRs are being reviewed promptly and we're able to keep track of what's being worked on and issues that need to be addressed.
3. Code contributions: We've implemented a lot of the core functionalities and we're making significant progress towards the final product.
* Goal: Each member of the team should keep everyone on the same page about what they are currently working on using the Kanban board even for non-coding tasks for better task management. We should track everyone's contributions and make sure everyone is able to speak up if they are having any trouble. New UI designs should be discussed promptly in Figma before implementation. Also, we should start planning the final presentation and the envisioned final product. 
* Commitment: We will make sure to stick on the key areas of improvement and make progress towards the final product.


## Notes:
These are miscellaneous notes I took from the retro and we can keep these in mind.
1. UI: everyone on the same page of what the UI should look like when implementing new stuff (messages, DM, etc). Wisely use Figma so we're not disagreeing after PRs/merges.
2. PR communication: We've been doing pretty good, but we could check in more often and be more responsive to messages. But I also understand that people are busy and we can be more flexible with the time we give for reviews.
3. Kanban board: At this point, we should figure out what we stil wanna add and assign everyone to have something to do. Also we should add tasks that are not necessarily coding so we know everyone's contributions.
4. Code finalization and presentation: The presentation should be simple but we should still keep in mind about upcoming deadlines and plan out the slides beforehand.
