# Date of Retrospective: 03/05/25

* Led by: [Shelly Zhu]
* Present: Allen Hu, Anthony Jin (Remote), Maria Saucedo-Flores, Shelly Zhu, Wesley Chiba, Zhenyu Yu, Hannah Su
* Absent: None

## Action item

* Goal: Each member of the team should keep everyone on the same page about what they are currently working on using the Kanban board even for non-coding tasks for better task management. New UI designs should be discussed in Figma before implementation. Start planning the final presentation and the envisioned final product. 

* Change/Experiment: We will enforce a habit of updating the Kanban board regularly by ensuring that each team member moves tasks through the appropriate columns and adds brief status updates as necessary. We will also add non-coding tasks to the board to track everyone's contributions. We will discuss UI implementations on Figma more actively. PRs should be reviewed promptly and more carefully.

* Measurement: 
Success will be measured by:
- Tracking the frequency of updates made by each team member on the Kanban board.
- Monitoring the movement of tasks from "To Do" to "In Progress" and "Done" to ensure steady progress.
- Making sure everyone is able to speak up in class or on Slack if they are having any trouble.
- Agreeing on the UI design before implementing it to avoid confusion during PR reviews.


## Retro Assessment 

* We used the Start, Stop, Continue retro format. We had the team type up what they thought we should start, stop, continue in the team Slack and submit at the same time. Then we identified the common points and asked people to elaborate.
* I think this retro helped us identify key areas for improvement, particularly in communication, task management, and UI design for final product. We recognized that while progress is being made, there is room to streamline our workflow and ensure everyone stays aligned.
* This time, people were more comfortable with this retro format and were able to speak up and share their thoughts. As we approach the final line, we hope to maintain our good communication and work together to finish the project.

## Experiment/Change

notes:
1. UI: everyone on the same page of what the UI should look like, implement new stuff (messages, DM, etc) Use Figma so we're not disagreeing after PRs
2. PR communication: doing pretty good, could check in more often 
3. Kanban board: figure out what we stil wanna add, assign everyone to have something to do 
add tasks that are not necessary coding, expand the board so we know everyone's tasks 
4. Code finalization and presentation: simple presentation, make slides beforehand
