## Bio

I'm a 4th year CS student. I have experience in backend development using python, golang, java, js. 

## Project idea

I think we can start with sharing each team member's strength and interest, then split the work based on our background (and even assign a role to each person). Then we can try to find an effective way to communicate after class, like through slack / imessage / discord. After that, we need to choose the framework for the project.
