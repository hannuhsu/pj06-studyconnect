Zhenyu Yu: I used ChatGPT to help me reuse the ClassesSidebar component from the home page for the courses page. I knew I wanted something similar on the courses page, and wanted to reuse the component, but didn't know exactly how to refactor the page and the component so that the component would work on both pages. I sent ChatGPT the component code and asked it to refactor it so that it would update as users added and removed courses from their joined list on the courses page without breaking functionality while on the home page. ChatGPT was able to do this really quickly and the result was a properly refactored component usable on both pages. To ensure the output was correct, I had to manually test that both pages were working as intended afterwards. I also had it explain to me what it changed so I can check the differences and ensure it was understandable and correct. To make it more accurate, I only sent in the component's code and explained the functionality I wanted it to have on both pages, instead of also sending in the pages' code. I think this was extremely helpful and will be helpful in my future coding efforts by helping me refactor code to be used in multiple places and also to understand older code for refactoring or changing. It can also be useful just to ask it to explain parts of older code to get refamiliarized with it quickly especially as the codebase expands.

Allen Hu: I used GitHub Copilot to modify the create-profile page. Previously, the page overwrites the user info's every data entry with their inputs, and also set the joinedClasses column to an empty list. However, if the user has already joined some classes, then once it uploads the profile, the previously joined classes will be overwritten. So I asked Copilot to read my code, update the logic of it such that it first tries to fetch the user's data from DB, and when the user submit new info, check whether the joinedClasses list is empty. If not, do not update it. Then Copilot quickly updated my code based on my prompt, and it completed the task well. I think one of the key idea in cooperation with AI is to break down an issue into several small tasks. The best case is that you understand the project and what you are doing, then you introduce the context first, and directly tell the AI what to do, not asking it, and test the new codes before moving on to the next small task. The copilots might also perform better if you already have some functioning codes and ask them to do some modification after understanding the existing codes, such that their behavior will be more controllable compared to starting from scratch. 

Anthony Jin: I experimented with ChatGPT to group and target specific work areas based on MVP feedback, as well as provide a prioritized list of next steps. This tool was very useful in providing a comprehensive summary of main feedback points from the feedback, and could help to provide direction for future features and areas of improvement based on our MVP demo. To ensure the AI-grouped feedback was accurate, I cross-checked all feedback against the original MVP feedback and made sure there were no hallucinations. I also played around with the prompt, incorporating terms like "group and highlight most relevant based on occurrence" versus just "group feedback", finding that the more specific I got with my prompts, the more conduicive the results were to my/the team's needs. Finally, requesting prioritized next steps did result in a workable list; however, the priority never completely aligned with the team's needs, though it was always roughly accurate.
