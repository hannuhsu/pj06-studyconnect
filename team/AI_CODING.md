Anthony Jin: I experimented with ChatGPT to group and target specific work areas based on MVP feedback, as well as provide a prioritized list of next steps. This tool was very useful in providing a comprehensive summary of main feedback points from the feedback, and could help to provide direction for future features and areas of improvement based on our MVP demo. To ensure the AI-grouped feedback was accurate, I cross-checked all feedback against the original MVP feedback and made sure there were no hallucinations. I also played around with the prompt, incorporating terms like "group and highlight most relevant based on occurrence" versus just "group feedback", finding that the more specific I got with my prompts, the more conduicive the results were to my/the team's needs. Finally, requesting prioritized next steps did result in a workable list; however, the priority never completely aligned with the team's needs, though it was always roughly accurate.
