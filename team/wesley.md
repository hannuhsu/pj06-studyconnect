I thought this project idea would be nice since I worked on a similar project during CMPSC 184,
where I worked on a mobile app project for creating study groups for students to browse and join.

I think some good ideas to start off with is to discuss how we are going to split the work between
the team, since I noticed in previous classes there can be miscommunications on what each member is
working on. Additionally, we should have a basic plan on how the UI is going to be layed out, otherwise
we can have problems with the UI looking disorganized.
